					I wish I had a clue. You know the saying "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwknFJpjl9g" target="_blank">It's better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven't done</a>"? Well, let me tell you, that's a punk anthem, not a motto worth living by. 
					<b>Here's another motto, by your's truly: It's better not to regret anything you've done at all</b>. 
					
					<br><br>But we're humans, and humans are assholes, built to make mistakes, ones that can 
					sometimnes feel beautiful, seemingly act on our behalf. Ones that are easily dismissed as redundant, weightless. In the end, they all make someone's
					life a little less worth living. 
					
					<br><br>I've been busting my own balls for 15 years or so trying to understand what added value am I bringing to the world. I still haven't quite figured that out, 
							But I guess some valuable information can be learned from what I did wrong, and man, do I have a lot to share in this field.
